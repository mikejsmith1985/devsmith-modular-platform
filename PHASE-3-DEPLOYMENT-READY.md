## 🏗️ Architecture Integration

### Main Logs Service (`cmd/logs/main.go`)
```go
// Lines 178-207: Complete Phase 3 initialization
→ HealthStorageService created
→ HealthPolicyService created + defaults loaded
→ AutoRepairService created
→ Background scheduler started
→ 7 API routes registered
→ UI handler initialized
```

### Service Dependencies
```
WebSocketHub → RedisConnection
     ↓
HealthScheduler → StorageService → Database
     ↓                  ↓
AutoRepairService ←────┴─ PolicyService
     ↓
Repair Actions → Logged to Database
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Run Migrations
```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres logs
# Wait for database to initialize
```

### 2. Access Dashboard
```bash
http://localhost:3000/healthcheck
```

### 3. Check Health Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8082/api/health/history
```

### 4. Configure Policies
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8082/api/health/policies/review \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "max_response_time_ms": 1000,
    "auto_repair_enabled": true,
    "repair_strategy": "restart"
  }'
```

### 5. Monitor Real-time
- Dashboard shows updates every 5 minutes
- WebSocket broadcasts health events
- Trend data updates continuously

---

## 📊 System Behavior

### Automatic (Every 5 Minutes)
- Runs health checks on all services
- Stores results to database
- Analyzes trends
- Compares against policies
- Triggers auto-repair if needed
- Logs all actions

### On-Demand
- API endpoints callable anytime
- Manual repairs can be triggered
- Policies can be updated
- Dashboard data loads on request

### Real-Time
- WebSocket hub broadcasts updates
- Policies applied immediately
- Dashboard refreshes automatically

---

## ✨ Quality Assurance

### Compilation
```bash
✅ go build ./cmd/logs                 [EXIT: 0]
✅ go build ./internal/logs/services   [EXIT: 0]
✅ templ generate                      [EXIT: 0]
```

### Code Quality
```
✅ No lint errors
✅ No compilation warnings
✅ All field names match
✅ All imports resolved
✅ Proper error handling
✅ Thread-safe operations
```

### Testing
```
✅ Unit tests for policies (config management)
✅ Auto-repair logic tested
✅ Template compilation verified
✅ Database schema migration ready
✅ API endpoint signatures correct
```
