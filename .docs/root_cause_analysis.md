# Root Cause Analysis

## Document Purpose
This document provides a detailed analysis of recurring issues encountered during the implementation of the Analytics Service foundation. It includes strategies for prevention and recommendations for improvement.

## Recurring Issues

### 1. Type Mismatches
**Description:** Argument types passed to functions or methods often do not match the expected types.
**Example:** Passing a `string` instead of an `int` to `NewTopIssuesService`.
**Resolution:**
- Validate argument types before implementation.
- Use IDE auto-complete to ensure correct method signatures.
- Write unit tests to catch type mismatches early.

### 2. Undefined References
**Description:** Missing method definitions or incorrect imports lead to build failures.
**Example:** `FindAllServices` method missing in `MockAggregationRepository`.
**Resolution:**
- Define all required methods in mock implementations.
- Use static analysis tools to identify undefined references.

### 3. Redundant Fixes
**Description:** Fixes applied to one test file are often repeated in others due to shared dependencies.
**Example:** Updating `MockLogReader` in multiple test files.
**Resolution:**
- Consolidate shared mocks in a `testutils` package.
- Refactor tests to use common setup functions.

### 4. Unused Imports
**Description:** Test files often include unused imports, leading to clutter and potential confusion.
**Example:** `trend_service_test.go` importing `fmt` without usage.
**Resolution:**
- Run `goimports` before committing changes.
- Use IDE linting tools to highlight unused imports.

### 5. Missing Test Files
**Description:** Certain packages lack test files, resulting in incomplete coverage.
**Example:** `internal/logs/models` has no test files.
**Resolution:**
- Create test files for all packages.
- Ensure 70%+ unit test coverage and 90%+ critical path coverage.

### 6. Mock Setup Alignment
**Description:** Mocks in tests often fail due to mismatched expectations or incorrect setup.
**Example:** `FindAllServices` mock not being called in `TestAggregatorService_RunHourlyAggregation`.
**Resolution:**
- Ensure mock expectations align with actual method calls.
- Use debug logs to trace execution flow and verify mock interactions.
- Simplify test cases to isolate specific issues.

## Strategies for Prevention

1. **Pre-Implementation Validation**
   - Validate package structure and imports before writing tests.
   - Use `go build` to catch syntax errors early.

2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   - Write failing tests first (RED phase).
   - Implement minimal code to pass tests (GREEN phase).
   - Refactor code while keeping tests green (REFACTOR phase).

3. **Code Reviews**
   - Conduct peer reviews to catch issues missed during development.
   - Use automated tools like `golangci-lint` for static analysis.

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update documentation with lessons learned from recurring issues.
   - Maintain a troubleshooting guide for common problems.

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Enhanced IDE Integration**
   - Use IDE features like auto-complete and linting to reduce errors.

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Integrate tests into CI/CD pipelines to catch issues early.

3. **Mock Consolidation**
   - Consolidate mock definitions in a `testutils` package.

4. **Regular Refactoring**
   - Refactor code periodically to improve maintainability.

5. **Team Collaboration**
   - Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing to prevent recurring issues.
