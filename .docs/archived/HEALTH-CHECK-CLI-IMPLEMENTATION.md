# Health Check CLI Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Version:** 1.0

## What Was Built

A lightweight wrapper script (`./scripts/health-check-cli.sh`) that provides Copilot and developers with fast, easy-to-use system diagnostics without requiring the frontend or any complex setup.

## Key Features

✅ **Executable Path:** `./scripts/health-check-cli.sh`  
✅ **No Frontend Required:** Standalone CLI tool  
✅ **Multiple Output Formats:**
- Human-readable (default) - colored, formatted output
- JSON (`--json`) - parseable by jq and scripts
- Continuous monitoring (`--watch`) - 5-second intervals

✅ **Phase 1, 2, 3 Checks:**
- Phase 1: Container status, health endpoints, database
- Phase 2: Gateway routing, performance metrics, dependencies
- Phase 3: Security scans, trends, policies, auto-repair

✅ **Fast:** < 1 second for basic checks

## Implementation Details

### Files Created

1. **`./scripts/health-check-cli.sh`** - Main wrapper script
   - 200+ lines of well-documented bash
   - Supports --json, --watch, --store, --advanced, --db-url flags
   - Integrated help system (`--help`)
   - Executable and ready to use

2. **`./scripts/README-HEALTH-CHECK.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Integration patterns
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - JSON output reference

### Files Updated

1. **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** - Added comprehensive section
   - **Step 3.5 (NEW):** Health Check CLI usage guide
   - **Step 3.6 (formerly 3.5):** Updated Docker Validation Workflow
   - ~250 lines of detailed instructions
   - Includes workflow examples and troubleshooting

## How Copilot Should Use It

### Before Starting Work
```bash
./scripts/health-check-cli.sh
```

### While Implementing Features
```bash
# Terminal 1: Monitor health continuously
./scripts/health-check-cli.sh --watch

# Terminal 2: Make changes and rebuild
vim internal/review/services/...
docker-compose up -d --build review

# Terminal 3: Run tests
go test ./internal/review/services/...
```

### When Troubleshooting
```bash
# Get JSON output for debugging
./scripts/health-check-cli.sh --json

# Parse specific service
./scripts/health-check-cli.sh --json | jq '.Checks[] | select(.Name=="review")'

# Check for failures
./scripts/health-check-cli.sh --json | jq '.Checks[] | select(.Status!="pass")'
```

### Before Creating PR
```bash
# Quick check
./scripts/health-check-cli.sh

# Full validation
./scripts/docker-validate.sh
```

## What to Add to Copilot Context

When starting Copilot work on Review features, add this context:

```
IMPORTANT: System Health Check Instructions
============================================

Use the health check CLI for all system diagnostics:

1. Before starting work:
   ./scripts/health-check-cli.sh

2. While implementing (run in Terminal 1):
   ./scripts/health-check-cli.sh --watch

3. When diagnosing issues:
   ./scripts/health-check-cli.sh --json | jq '.Checks[] | select(.Status!="pass")'

4. Before creating PR:
   ./scripts/health-check-cli.sh
   ./scripts/docker-validate.sh (only if --watch shows all green)

DO NOT use docker-validate.sh for quick checks during development.
It's too comprehensive. Use health-check-cli.sh for fast feedback.

The healthcheck app provides Phase 1, 2, and 3 diagnostics:
- Phase 1: Container/HTTP/Database checks
- Phase 2: Gateway routing, performance metrics
- Phase 3: Security scans, trends, policies
```

## Integration with Review App

When Copilot implements Review features:

1. ✅ Can run health checks without frontend
2. ✅ Can monitor health in real-time with --watch
3. ✅ Can parse JSON output for scripting
4. ✅ Has fast feedback loop (< 1 second)
5. ✅ Replaces need for docker-validate.sh during development

## Documentation References

- **Primary:** `./scripts/README-HEALTH-CHECK.md` - Complete usage guide
- **Instructions:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Section 3.5 (800+ words)
- **Architecture:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Section 12 (Health Check Integration)
- **Phase 3 Plan:** `health-check-phase-3.plan.md` - Detailed implementation

## Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose | Use When |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `./scripts/health-check-cli.sh` | Basic health check | Starting work, verifying system |
| `./scripts/health-check-cli.sh --json` | JSON output | Parsing, debugging, scripting |
| `./scripts/health-check-cli.sh --watch` | Continuous monitor | Developing, watching for issues |
| `./scripts/docker-validate.sh` | Full validation | Before PR, comprehensive check |

## Status for Copilot

**✅ Ready to use immediately:**

```bash
# 1. Build healthcheck binary (if not exists)
go build -o healthcheck ./cmd/healthcheck

# 2. Start using health check CLI
./scripts/health-check-cli.sh

# 3. When implementing Review features:
./scripts/health-check-cli.sh --watch
```

## Testing the Implementation

```bash
# Test basic functionality
./scripts/health-check-cli.sh

# Test JSON output
./scripts/health-check-cli.sh --json | jq '.Summary'

# Test help
./scripts/health-check-cli.sh --help

# Test watch mode (press Ctrl+C to exit)
./scripts/health-check-cli.sh --watch
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Copilot can immediately use this for Review app implementation
2. ⏱️ Optional: Implement `--store` flag to save results to database (Phase 2)
3. ⏱️ Optional: Add WebSocket real-time dashboard (Phase 2)

## Summary

**Goal:** Provide Copilot with fast, independent health diagnostics while implementing Review features.

**Status:** ✅ Complete and ready to use

**What Copilot gets:**
- Fast CLI tool (< 1 second)
- No frontend dependencies
- Real-time monitoring (--watch)
- JSON output for parsing
- Comprehensive documentation in copilot-instructions.md

**How to tell Copilot:** Add the context above to instructions when starting Review feature work.
