# DevLog - October 19, 2025

## Session 1: Issue #001 Validation & Workflow Fix

**Time:** Morning
**Participants:** Mike, Claude Code
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Summary

Validated Copilot's work on Issue #001 (Project Scaffolding) and discovered critical infrastructure gaps. Restructured issues to follow proper workflow (one feature per branch). Fixed issue numbering and migrated specifications.

---

## Problems Discovered

### 1. Incomplete Scaffolding (Issue #001)

**What Copilot Created:**
- ✅ Basic Go project structure (cmd/, internal/, config/)
- ✅ Minimal service stubs for all 4 services
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration skeleton
- ✅ Basic Makefile
- ✅ .env.example with configuration

**What Was Missing:**
- ❌ No Dockerfiles (docker-compose.yml referenced them but they didn't exist)
- ❌ No nginx.conf (referenced but missing)
- ❌ No postgres init script (referenced but missing)
- ❌ Services just printed messages and exited (not persistent HTTP servers)
- ❌ No dev.sh or test.sh scripts
- ❌ No tests

### 2. Critical Container Issue

**Problem:** Services immediately exit after printing startup message
```go
// Current (BROKEN):
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Portal service starting...")
    // Container exits here
}
```

**Impact:**
- Docker containers stop immediately
- Nginx cannot resolve upstream hostnames
- Error: "host not found in upstream 'portal'"

**Root Cause:** Services need to run persistent HTTP servers, not just print and exit

**Solution:**
```go
// Fixed (PERSISTENT):
func main() {
    router := gin.Default()
    router.GET("/health", healthHandler)
    router.GET("/", rootHandler)
    router.Run(":8080")  // Runs forever
}
```

### 3. Workflow Violation

**Problem:** Created Issue #002 that tried to do multiple things:
- Fix HTTP servers
- Add Dockerfiles
- Add Nginx config
- Add PostgreSQL init
- Add scripts
- Update docker-compose

**Violation:** Multiple features on one branch breaks the workflow principle:
> **One issue = One branch = One feature**

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Migrated Specifications to Issue #001

Updated `.docs/issues/001-copilot-project-scaffolding.md` to include:

**Added Sections:**
- Complete Dockerfile specifications (lines 347-417)
  - Multi-stage builds (builder + runtime)
  - Health checks
  - Port assignments (8080, 8081, 8082, 8083)
- Service main.go with Gin HTTP servers (lines 421-479)
  - Persistent servers (don't exit)
  - `/health` endpoint for Docker health checks
  - `/` root endpoint with service info
- Nginx gateway configuration (lines 483-568)
  - Upstream definitions
  - Proper routing
  - WebSocket support for logs
- Development scripts (lines 572-636)
  - dev.sh (start all services)
  - test.sh (run tests with coverage)
- Updated docker-compose.yml (lines 640-773)
  - Health checks for all services
  - Docker networks
  - Proper dependencies
- User model placeholder (lines 777-793)

**Updated Acceptance Criteria:**
- Expanded from 11 to 30 checkboxes
- Organized into categories: Core Files, Docker Infrastructure, Service Implementation, Scripts, Integration Testing
- Added critical requirement: "Containers stay running (don't exit immediately)"

**Updated Testing Commands:**
- Complete end-to-end test flow
- Health check verification for all services
- Database schema verification
- Service accessibility via Nginx gateway

### 2. Reorganized Issue Numbers

**Before:**
- Issue #001: Project Scaffolding (incomplete)
- Issue #002: Complete Scaffolding (workflow violation - too many features)
- Issue #003: CI/CD Setup

**After:**
- Issue #001: Project Scaffolding (**complete specification**)
- Issue #002: CI/CD Setup (moved from #003)
- ~~Issue #003~~: Deleted (merged into #001)

**Changes Made:**
- Renamed `.docs/issues/003-copilot-cicd-setup.md` → `002-copilot-cicd-setup.md`
- Updated all branch names: `feature/003-cicd-setup` → `feature/002-cicd-setup`
- Updated dependencies: Issue #002 now depends on Issue #001
- Updated all cross-references in documentation

### 3. Updated Commit Message

New commit message reflects complete scope:
```
feat(infra): complete project scaffolding and Docker infrastructure

- Go module with dependencies (Gin, Templ, pgx, zerolog)
- Docker Compose with health checks, networks, and all 4 services
- PostgreSQL schema initialization (4 schemas: portal, reviews, logs, analytics)
- Dockerfiles for all 4 services (multi-stage builds)
- Nginx gateway configuration with proper routing
- Persistent HTTP servers for all services (Gin with /health endpoints)
- Development scripts (setup.sh, dev.sh, test.sh)
- Makefile with common commands
- User model placeholder

CRITICAL FIX: Services now run persistent HTTP servers instead of
just printing and exiting. This fixes Nginx upstream resolution errors.

All services are now buildable, runnable, and accessible via Nginx gateway.
```

---

## Decisions Made

### 1. Complete Issue #001 on Current Branch
**Decision:** Have Copilot finish all scaffolding work on the existing `feature/001-copilot-project-scaffolding` branch before creating PR.

**Rationale:**
- Issue #001 was supposed to be "complete scaffolding"
- Breaking into smaller issues would create artificial splits
- All missing pieces are infrastructure boilerplate (Copilot's strength)
- Keeps workflow clean: one complete feature per branch

### 2. Future Issues Must Be Focused
**Decision:** All future issues must have single, clear responsibility.

**Examples of Good Issues:**
- Issue #002: CI/CD Setup (only GitHub Actions workflows)
- Issue #003: Portal Authentication (only GitHub OAuth)
- Issue #004: User Dashboard UI (only dashboard page)

**Examples of Bad Issues (Don't Do This):**
- ❌ "Complete Portal Service" (too broad)
- ❌ "Fix issues and add features" (multiple features)
- ❌ "Authentication and authorization and user management" (three features)

### 3. Devlog System Established
**Decision:** Create `.docs/devlog/YYYY-MM-DD.md` entries for each session.

**Purpose:**
- Track decisions and rationale
- Document problems discovered
- Record solutions implemented
- Different from recovery logs (crash recovery) or session logs (automated)
- Human-readable session summaries

**Format:**
- Date-based entries
- Session number (if multiple per day)
- Summary, Problems, Solutions, Decisions sections
- Action items for next session

---

## Action Items for Copilot

### Immediate (On Current Branch)

**Branch:** `feature/001-copilot-project-scaffolding`

**Task:** Re-read and implement `.docs/issues/001-copilot-project-scaffolding.md`

**Priority 1 - Fix Container Issue:**
1. Replace all 4 `cmd/*/main.go` files with Gin HTTP servers
   - `cmd/portal/main.go` (port 8080)
   - `cmd/review/main.go` (port 8081)
   - `cmd/logs/main.go` (port 8082)
   - `cmd/analytics/main.go` (port 8083)
2. Each must have `/health` and `/` endpoints
3. Each must run persistent server (not exit)

**Priority 2 - Add Missing Infrastructure:**
1. Create 4x Dockerfiles (`cmd/*/Dockerfile`)
2. Create `docker/nginx/nginx.conf`
3. Create `docker/postgres/init-schemas.sql`
4. Create `scripts/dev.sh` and `scripts/test.sh`
5. Update `docker-compose.yml` with health checks
6. Create `internal/portal/models/user.go`

**Priority 3 - Verify:**
1. Run `make setup`
2. Run `make dev`
3. Test all health endpoints via curl
4. Verify `docker-compose ps` shows all services "healthy"
5. Run `make test`

### After Issue #001 is Merged

**Next Issue:** Issue #002 - CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- **Branch:** `feature/002-cicd-setup`
- **Spec:** `.docs/issues/002-copilot-cicd-setup.md`
- **Scope:** GitHub Actions workflows only
- **Assignee:** Copilot

---

## Technical Notes

### Port Assignments
- Portal: 8080
- Review: 8081
- Logs: 8082
- Analytics: 8083
- Nginx: 3000 (external), 80 (internal)
- PostgreSQL: 5432

### Database Schemas
- `portal` - Authentication, user management, app browser
- `reviews` - Code reading sessions, 5 reading modes, AI analysis
- `logs` - Application logs, telemetry, real-time streaming
- `analytics` - Log analysis, anomaly detection, reports

### Health Check Requirements
All services must implement:
```go
router.GET("/health", func(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
        "service": "service-name",
        "status":  "healthy",
    })
})
```

Docker health checks use:
```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:PORT/health || exit 1
```

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Validate AI Work Thoroughly
**Lesson:** Even simple scaffolding tasks can have critical gaps.

**Application:** Always run validation checklist before marking complete:
- Are files actually created (not just referenced)?
- Do services run persistently?
- Can services communicate?
- Do health checks work?

### 2. Workflow Discipline is Critical
**Lesson:** Easy to accidentally bundle multiple features into one issue.

**Application:** Before creating an issue, ask:
- Can this be described in one sentence?
- Does it have a single responsibility?
- Would splitting it make the work harder or easier?

### 3. Issue Specs Must Be Complete
**Lesson:** Incomplete specs lead to incomplete implementations.

**Application:** Every issue spec must include:
- Complete code examples
- Acceptance criteria (checkboxes)
- Testing commands
- Expected outputs
- Clear success metrics

### 4. Nginx Requires Persistent Upstreams
**Lesson:** Nginx cannot route to containers that exit immediately.

**Application:** All services behind Nginx must:
- Run persistent processes
- Implement health checks
- Start before Nginx (use `depends_on` with health conditions)

## Session 2: Copilot Completion & Aider Handoff

**Time:** Afternoon
**Participants:** Mike, Claude Code, Copilot, Aider
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress

---

### What Happened

#### Copilot Completed Issue #001 (~70%)

**Created (Uncommitted):**
- ✅ 4x Dockerfiles (multi-stage builds, health checks)
- ✅ 4x main.go with persistent Gin HTTP servers
- ✅ Nginx config (has issues)
- ✅ PostgreSQL init script
- ✅ docker-compose.yml (has issues)
- ✅ User model

**Commits Made:**
1. `57c92e2` - Infrastructure work (16 files, 433 insertions)
2. `a63aa36` - Claude's documentation (10 files, 2919 insertions)

**Issues Found:**
- ❌ docker-compose.yml: Wrong build context, missing health checks, wrong ports
- ❌ nginx.conf: Wrong port (3000 vs 80), missing upstream ports, wrong routing
- ❌ Missing scripts/ directory

#### Copilot Moved to Issue #002 (CI/CD)

**Branch:** `feature/002-copilot-cicd-setup`
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Created:**
- GitHub Actions workflows (4 files)
- .golangci.yml
- .codecov.yml

**Question from Copilot:** "Should I push and create PR?"
**Answer:** No - Mike handles push/PR per workflow

#### Aider Attempted Issue #001 Fixes

**Problem:** Aider got stuck in infinite loop
- Asked to read AIDER-TASKS.md
- Got truncated summary (bullet points only)
- Kept asking for content repeatedly
- Never started actual work

**Root Cause:** Wrong file provided (task summary vs issue spec with code)

---

### Lessons Learned

#### 1. Aider Prompting Strategy

**❌ Wrong Approach:**
```
Read AIDER-TASKS.md and fix all Priority 1-3 items
```
- Aider reads summary file without code examples
- Gets stuck asking for content
- Never gets to actual implementation

**✅ Correct Approach:**
```
/add .docs/issues/001-copilot-project-scaffolding.md
/add docker-compose.yml

Implement the docker-compose.yml specification from lines 640-773 of the issue file.
Then fix nginx.conf per lines 483-568.
```
- Point directly to issue spec with complete code
- Reference specific line numbers
- One task at a time

#### 2. Agent Workflow Boundaries

**Question:** Should agents push branches and create PRs?

**Answer:** Depends on workflow configuration, but current setup:
- ✅ Agent: Implement, commit
- ❌ Agent: Push, create PR (Mike does this)
- ✅ Agent: Can create PR in some workflows (not current)

**Rationale:** Mike reviews commits before they go to remote

#### 3. OpenHands vs Aider Performance

**Question:** Would OpenHands + DeepSeek be better?

**Answer:** Probably not for this case:
- OpenHands has API key issues with local models
- DeepSeek has Go code quality issues
- Speed issue is inherent to local models (5-20 tok/s vs API 50-100 tok/s)
- Better: OpenHands + API (but costs money)

**Speed Comparison:**
| Model | Tokens/sec | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| qwen2.5-coder:32b | 5-10 | Complex features |
| qwen2.5-coder:14b | 15-25 | Most tasks ⭐ |
| deepseek-coder-v2:16b | 20-30 | Simple tasks (Go issues) |
| Claude API | 50-100 | Reviews, architecture |

#### 4. Copilot + Issue Templates is MUCH Faster

**Discovery:** With detailed issue templates, Copilot is:
- ✅ **Super fast** (API-based, no local model lag)
- ✅ **Follows specs precisely** (with complete code examples in issues)
- ✅ **Works in IDE** (no separate window/context needed)
- ✅ **Commits as it goes** (good workflow)

**vs Aider:**
- ❌ Slow (local model, 5-20 tok/s)
- ❌ Gets stuck (wrong file types, loop issues)
- ❌ Separate terminal (if you change branches, breaks Aider session)
- ❌ Context management issues

**Conclusion:** For infrastructure/scaffolding with detailed specs, **Copilot >> Aider**

**New Workflow:**
- Copilot: Infrastructure, scaffolding, configs (with detailed issue specs)
- Claude: Architecture, specs, reviews
- Aider: Reserved for complex features that need autonomous multi-file work (if we solve the prompting issues)

## How to Review Commits (For Mike)

### Quick Review Commands

```bash
# Switch to the branch you want to review
git checkout feature/002-copilot-cicd-setup

# See list of commits on this branch (not on development)
git log development..HEAD --oneline

# See what files changed in total
git diff development..HEAD --stat

# See all changes (full diff)
git diff development..HEAD

# Review specific commit
git show <commit-hash>

# Review specific file
git diff development..HEAD -- path/to/file
```

### Detailed Review Process

#### Step 1: Check Branch and Commits

```bash
# Make sure you're on the right branch
git branch --show-current

# See all commits on this branch
git log development..HEAD --oneline

# Example output:
# abc1234 feat(ci): add test-and-build workflow
# def5678 feat(ci): add security scan workflow
# ghi9012 feat(ci): add linter config
```

#### Step 2: Review Each Commit

```bash
# Show details of one commit
git show abc1234

# Shows:
# - Commit message
# - Files changed
# - Full diff of changes
```

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Commit message follows Conventional Commits (`feat(ci):`, `fix(auth):`, etc.)
- ✅ Files make sense for the issue
- ✅ No sensitive data (passwords, API keys)
- ✅ Code matches the spec
- ✅ No obviously broken code

#### Step 3: Review Acceptance Criteria

```bash
# Open the issue spec
cat .docs/issues/002-copilot-cicd-setup.md | grep -A 20 "Acceptance Criteria"
```

Check each checkbox:
- [ ] All workflow files created?
- [ ] Linter config created?
- [ ] Files in correct locations?

#### Step 4: Test Locally (Optional)

```bash
# Try to run what was created
# For CI/CD workflows, you can use 'act' to test locally:
act push -W .github/workflows/test-and-build.yml

# Or just verify syntax
cat .github/workflows/test-and-build.yml | grep -E "error|invalid"
```

#### Step 5: Decision

**If everything looks good:**
```bash
# Push the branch
git push origin feature/002-copilot-cicd-setup

# Create PR (via GitHub UI or CLI)
gh pr create --title "feat(ci): add CI/CD workflows" --base development
```

**If there are issues:**
```bash
# Add comments for what needs fixing
# Tell the agent to make corrections
# Review again after fixes
```
