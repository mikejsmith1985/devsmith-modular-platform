# DevLog - October 19, 2025

## Session 1: Issue #001 Validation & Workflow Fix

**Time:** Morning
**Participants:** Mike, Claude Code
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Summary

Validated Copilot's work on Issue #001 (Project Scaffolding) and discovered critical infrastructure gaps. Restructured issues to follow proper workflow (one feature per branch). Fixed issue numbering and migrated specifications.

---

## Problems Discovered

### 1. Incomplete Scaffolding (Issue #001)

**What Copilot Created:**
- ✅ Basic Go project structure (cmd/, internal/, config/)
- ✅ Minimal service stubs for all 4 services
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration skeleton
- ✅ Basic Makefile
- ✅ .env.example with configuration

**What Was Missing:**
- ❌ No Dockerfiles (docker-compose.yml referenced them but they didn't exist)
- ❌ No nginx.conf (referenced but missing)
- ❌ No postgres init script (referenced but missing)
- ❌ Services just printed messages and exited (not persistent HTTP servers)
- ❌ No dev.sh or test.sh scripts
- ❌ No tests

### 2. Critical Container Issue

**Problem:** Services immediately exit after printing startup message
```go
// Current (BROKEN):
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Portal service starting...")
    // Container exits here
}
```

**Impact:**
- Docker containers stop immediately
- Nginx cannot resolve upstream hostnames
- Error: "host not found in upstream 'portal'"

**Root Cause:** Services need to run persistent HTTP servers, not just print and exit

**Solution:**
```go
// Fixed (PERSISTENT):
func main() {
    router := gin.Default()
    router.GET("/health", healthHandler)
    router.GET("/", rootHandler)
    router.Run(":8080")  // Runs forever
}
```

### 3. Workflow Violation

**Problem:** Created Issue #002 that tried to do multiple things:
- Fix HTTP servers
- Add Dockerfiles
- Add Nginx config
- Add PostgreSQL init
- Add scripts
- Update docker-compose

**Violation:** Multiple features on one branch breaks the workflow principle:
> **One issue = One branch = One feature**

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Migrated Specifications to Issue #001

Updated `.docs/issues/001-copilot-project-scaffolding.md` to include:

**Added Sections:**
- Complete Dockerfile specifications (lines 347-417)
  - Multi-stage builds (builder + runtime)
  - Health checks
  - Port assignments (8080, 8081, 8082, 8083)
- Service main.go with Gin HTTP servers (lines 421-479)
  - Persistent servers (don't exit)
  - `/health` endpoint for Docker health checks
  - `/` root endpoint with service info
- Nginx gateway configuration (lines 483-568)
  - Upstream definitions
  - Proper routing
  - WebSocket support for logs
- Development scripts (lines 572-636)
  - dev.sh (start all services)
  - test.sh (run tests with coverage)
- Updated docker-compose.yml (lines 640-773)
  - Health checks for all services
  - Docker networks
  - Proper dependencies
- User model placeholder (lines 777-793)

**Updated Acceptance Criteria:**
- Expanded from 11 to 30 checkboxes
- Organized into categories: Core Files, Docker Infrastructure, Service Implementation, Scripts, Integration Testing
- Added critical requirement: "Containers stay running (don't exit immediately)"

**Updated Testing Commands:**
- Complete end-to-end test flow
- Health check verification for all services
- Database schema verification
- Service accessibility via Nginx gateway

### 2. Reorganized Issue Numbers

**Before:**
- Issue #001: Project Scaffolding (incomplete)
- Issue #002: Complete Scaffolding (workflow violation - too many features)
- Issue #003: CI/CD Setup

**After:**
- Issue #001: Project Scaffolding (**complete specification**)
- Issue #002: CI/CD Setup (moved from #003)
- ~~Issue #003~~: Deleted (merged into #001)

**Changes Made:**
- Renamed `.docs/issues/003-copilot-cicd-setup.md` → `002-copilot-cicd-setup.md`
- Updated all branch names: `feature/003-cicd-setup` → `feature/002-cicd-setup`
- Updated dependencies: Issue #002 now depends on Issue #001
- Updated all cross-references in documentation

### 3. Updated Commit Message

New commit message reflects complete scope:
```
feat(infra): complete project scaffolding and Docker infrastructure

- Go module with dependencies (Gin, Templ, pgx, zerolog)
- Docker Compose with health checks, networks, and all 4 services
- PostgreSQL schema initialization (4 schemas: portal, reviews, logs, analytics)
- Dockerfiles for all 4 services (multi-stage builds)
- Nginx gateway configuration with proper routing
- Persistent HTTP servers for all services (Gin with /health endpoints)
- Development scripts (setup.sh, dev.sh, test.sh)
- Makefile with common commands
- User model placeholder

CRITICAL FIX: Services now run persistent HTTP servers instead of
just printing and exiting. This fixes Nginx upstream resolution errors.

All services are now buildable, runnable, and accessible via Nginx gateway.
```

## Decisions Made

### 1. Complete Issue #001 on Current Branch
**Decision:** Have Copilot finish all scaffolding work on the existing `feature/001-copilot-project-scaffolding` branch before creating PR.

**Rationale:**
- Issue #001 was supposed to be "complete scaffolding"
- Breaking into smaller issues would create artificial splits
- All missing pieces are infrastructure boilerplate (Copilot's strength)
- Keeps workflow clean: one complete feature per branch

### 2. Future Issues Must Be Focused
**Decision:** All future issues must have single, clear responsibility.

**Examples of Good Issues:**
- Issue #002: CI/CD Setup (only GitHub Actions workflows)
- Issue #003: Portal Authentication (only GitHub OAuth)
- Issue #004: User Dashboard UI (only dashboard page)

**Examples of Bad Issues (Don't Do This):**
- ❌ "Complete Portal Service" (too broad)
- ❌ "Fix issues and add features" (multiple features)
- ❌ "Authentication and authorization and user management" (three features)

### 3. Devlog System Established
**Decision:** Create `.docs/devlog/YYYY-MM-DD.md` entries for each session.

**Purpose:**
- Track decisions and rationale
- Document problems discovered
- Record solutions implemented
- Different from recovery logs (crash recovery) or session logs (automated)
- Human-readable session summaries

**Format:**
- Date-based entries
- Session number (if multiple per day)
- Summary, Problems, Solutions, Decisions sections
- Action items for next session

## Action Items for Copilot

### Immediate (On Current Branch)

**Branch:** `feature/001-copilot-project-scaffolding`

**Task:** Re-read and implement `.docs/issues/001-copilot-project-scaffolding.md`

**Priority 1 - Fix Container Issue:**
1. Replace all 4 `cmd/*/main.go` files with Gin HTTP servers
   - `cmd/portal/main.go` (port 8080)
   - `cmd/review/main.go` (port 8081)
   - `cmd/logs/main.go` (port 8082)
   - `cmd/analytics/main.go` (port 8083)
2. Each must have `/health` and `/` endpoints
3. Each must run persistent server (not exit)

**Priority 2 - Add Missing Infrastructure:**
1. Create 4x Dockerfiles (`cmd/*/Dockerfile`)
2. Create `docker/nginx/nginx.conf`
3. Create `docker/postgres/init-schemas.sql`
4. Create `scripts/dev.sh` and `scripts/test.sh`
5. Update `docker-compose.yml` with health checks
6. Create `internal/portal/models/user.go`

**Priority 3 - Verify:**
1. Run `make setup`
2. Run `make dev`
3. Test all health endpoints via curl
4. Verify `docker-compose ps` shows all services "healthy"
5. Run `make test`

### After Issue #001 is Merged

**Next Issue:** Issue #002 - CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- **Branch:** `feature/002-cicd-setup`
- **Spec:** `.docs/issues/002-copilot-cicd-setup.md`
- **Scope:** GitHub Actions workflows only
- **Assignee:** Copilot

## Technical Notes

### Port Assignments
- Portal: 8080
- Review: 8081
- Logs: 8082
- Analytics: 8083
- Nginx: 3000 (external), 80 (internal)
- PostgreSQL: 5432

### Database Schemas
- `portal` - Authentication, user management, app browser
- `reviews` - Code reading sessions, 5 reading modes, AI analysis
- `logs` - Application logs, telemetry, real-time streaming
- `analytics` - Log analysis, anomaly detection, reports

### Health Check Requirements
All services must implement:
```go
router.GET("/health", func(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
        "service": "service-name",
        "status":  "healthy",
    })
})
```

Docker health checks use:
```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:PORT/health || exit 1
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Validate AI Work Thoroughly
**Lesson:** Even simple scaffolding tasks can have critical gaps.

**Application:** Always run validation checklist before marking complete:
- Are files actually created (not just referenced)?
- Do services run persistently?
- Can services communicate?
- Do health checks work?

### 2. Workflow Discipline is Critical
**Lesson:** Easy to accidentally bundle multiple features into one issue.

**Application:** Before creating an issue, ask:
- Can this be described in one sentence?
- Does it have a single responsibility?
- Would splitting it make the work harder or easier?

### 3. Issue Specs Must Be Complete
**Lesson:** Incomplete specs lead to incomplete implementations.

**Application:** Every issue spec must include:
- Complete code examples
- Acceptance criteria (checkboxes)
- Testing commands
- Expected outputs
- Clear success metrics

### 4. Nginx Requires Persistent Upstreams
**Lesson:** Nginx cannot route to containers that exit immediately.

**Application:** All services behind Nginx must:
- Run persistent processes
- Implement health checks
- Start before Nginx (use `depends_on` with health conditions)
