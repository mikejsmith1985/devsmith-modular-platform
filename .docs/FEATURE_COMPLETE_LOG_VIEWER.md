- Real-time log streaming via WebSocket
- Virtual scrolling for 10k+ logs
- Advanced filtering (level, service, date range)
- Search with debouncing (300ms)
- Expandable log details with stack traces
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Toast notifications for errors/warnings

## Usage Instructions

### Starting the Service
```bash
go run ./cmd/logs
# Or
go build -o logs ./cmd/logs
./logs
```

### Accessing the Dashboard
```
http://localhost:8082
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# All 31 E2E tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/logs_viewer_complete.spec.ts

# Specific test category
npx playwright test tests/e2e/logs_viewer_complete.spec.ts -g "Virtual scrolling"

# Headed mode (see browser)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/logs_viewer_complete.spec.ts --headed
```

### WebSocket Connection

- Filter params: `?level=ERROR&service=review&tags=critical`
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff

---

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. Virtual scrolling uses hide/show (not true DOM windowing)
2. Search is basic substring match (no regex)
3. No persistent storage of user preferences
4. Single service instance (no clustering)

### Planned Enhancements
1. Implement true DOM windowing library (Virtuoso/IntersectionObserver)
2. Add advanced search (regex, case-sensitive, complex filters)
3. Persist user filter preferences to local storage
4. Add CSV/JSON export functionality
5. Implement Web Worker for large datasets
6. Add log analytics dashboard
7. Multi-instance support with Redis pub/sub

---

## Support & Maintenance

### For New Developers
1. Read this document for feature overview
2. Review `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design
3. Check `.docs/GREEN_PHASE_LOG_VIEWER.md` for implementation details
4. Look at REFACTOR_PHASE_LOG_VIEWER.md for code organization

### For Debugging
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Use Chrome DevTools for WebSocket debugging
- Check server logs for backend errors
- Use Playwright test output for E2E failures

### For Contributing
- Follow existing code organization (9 sections in JS)
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions
- Add CSS variables for new colors
- Write tests using Playwright patterns
- Run full test suite before PR
