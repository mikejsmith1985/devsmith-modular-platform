# Feature 022: Rate Limiting & AI API Management - Implementation Status

**Date Started:** 2025-10-26  
**Current Phase:** RED Phase (Test Creation)  
**Branch:** `feature/022-rate-limiting-ai-api-management`  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

---

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Test Creation (RED Phase)

✅ **Rate Limiter Tests** (Commit 9c32aa9)
- 16 comprehensive tests
- Tests for: per-user limits, per-IP limits, quota tracking, window resets, concurrency, error handling
- Interface defined for RateLimiter
- Minimal stubs created to pass pre-commit

✅ **Queue Tests** (Commit f8b65da)
- 11 comprehensive tests
- Tests for: FIFO ordering, capacity limits, status tracking, concurrency, context cancellation
- Queue interface and types defined
- Minimal stubs created to pass pre-commit

### Phase 2: Test Creation Remaining

📝 **Pending Tests:**
- Backoff/Retry logic tests (5-8 tests)
- Circuit Breaker tests (5-8 tests)
- Cost Tracker tests (5-8 tests)

### Phase 3: Implementation (GREEN Phase)

🔄 **Ready to implement after tests committed:**
1. Rate limiter with Redis token bucket
2. FIFO queue with concurrent safety
3. Exponential backoff with jitter
4. Circuit breaker state machine
5. Cost tracker with database persistence

## Pre-commit Checks Status

✅ All current commits pass:
- Format checks (gofmt)
- Vet checks (go vet)
- Linter checks (golangci-lint)
- Import checks (goimports)
- Package comments
- Struct alignment
- Error handling (errors.Is usage)

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Next Commits)
1. Create remaining test files (backoff, circuit, cost_tracker)
2. Move to GREEN phase - implement each component
3. Verify all tests pass with implementations
4. Full build verification for review service

### Implementation Strategy
- Backoff: Simple exponential with jitter function
- Queue: In-memory FIFO with goroutine safety (sync.Mutex)
- Circuit Breaker: State machine with metrics
- Cost Tracker: Database model + service layer
- Rate Limiter: Redis token bucket (mock Redis for tests initially)

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests verify individual components
- Integration tests verify component interactions
- No mocking of internal components (only external APIs)

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   - All tests written BEFORE implementation
   - RED phase commits tests, GREEN phase implements
   - Separate commits for tests vs implementation

2. **Interface-First Design**
   - Define interfaces in tests
   - Minimal stubs satisfy pre-commit
   - Implementations added in GREEN phase

3. **Redis for Rate Limiting**
   - Token bucket algorithm  
   - Per-user and per-IP tracking
   - Configurable limits via environment

4. **Queue Design**
   - In-memory FIFO for local processing
   - Thread-safe with sync.Mutex
   - Status tracking for monitoring

5. **Database Schema**
   - reviews.ai_api_usage tracks all requests
   - reviews.user_quotas enforces limits
   - Proper indexing for performance

## Issues Encountered & Solutions

### ✅ Unused Import (Solved)
- **Issue:** require package imported but not used
- **Solution:** Removed unused import, only use testify/assert

### ✅ Struct Field Alignment (Solved)
- **Issue:** Linter complained about suboptimal field order
- **Solution:** Reordered fields, added nolint comment for readability tradeoff

### ✅ Error Comparison (Solved)
- **Issue:** Using == for error comparison instead of errors.Is
- **Solution:** Changed to errors.Is for proper wrapped error handling

### ✅ HTTP.NoBody (Solved)
- **Issue:** Using nil instead of http.NoBody in requests
- **Solution:** Changed to http.NoBody per gocritic linter

## Token Budget Remaining
- Started with: ~200k tokens
- Used so far: ~114k tokens  
- Remaining: ~86k tokens
- Current phase: RED (test creation)
- Next phase: GREEN (implementation)
