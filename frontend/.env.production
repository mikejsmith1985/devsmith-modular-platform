# Production Environment Configuration
# This file is used during production builds (npm run build)
#
# ⚠️ WARNING: This file OVERRIDES .env during production builds!
# ⚠️ If you change VITE_API_URL here, it affects ALL production builds
# ⚠️ For local development, use .env.development or .env.local instead
#
# DEBUGGING NOTES:
# - If built JS has wrong API_URL, check THIS file first (not .env)
# - Use "strings frontend/dist/assets/index-*.js | grep 'localhost:3000'" to verify
# - Built bundle should have: u="http://localhost:3000" NOT u="/api"

# Disable debug logging in production
# When false, console output is suppressed (only backend logs are kept)
VITE_DEBUG=false

# API endpoints (production - for Docker/localhost deployment)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3000
