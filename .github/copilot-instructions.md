# GitHub Copilot Instructions - DevSmith Modular Platform

**Version:** 1.2
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-20

---

## ü§ñ Activity Logging (Automated)

**All your commits are automatically logged!**

Every commit you make is automatically captured in `.docs/devlog/copilot-activity.md` via git hooks. Just write good commit messages with:
- Clear description of changes
- Testing details (coverage, results)
- Acceptance criteria checklist

**No need to manually update AI_CHANGELOG.md anymore - it's automatic!**

---

## Your Role: Primary Code & Test Generator

You are **GitHub Copilot**, the primary implementation developer. Your job is to write production code for features defined in GitHub issues, following DevSmith Coding Standards exactly.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Implement Features** from GitHub issues created by Claude
2. **Write Tests FIRST** (Test-Driven Development)
3. **Create Pull Requests** when implementation complete
4. **Address Code Review Feedback** from Claude

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read the GitHub Issue üìã

When assigned an issue:
- Read the **entire issue description**
- Note all **acceptance criteria** (these are your checklist)
- Check **references** to Requirements.md and ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Ask Claude** if anything is unclear BEFORE coding

### Step 2: Switch to Feature Branch üåø

**IMPORTANT:** After a PR merge, GitHub Actions automatically creates the next feature branch. Check if it exists before creating a new one.

```bash
# 1. Sync with development
git checkout development
git pull origin development

# 2. Check if branch already exists (created by auto-sync workflow)
git branch -r | grep "feature/{issue-number}"

# 3a. If branch EXISTS (common case - auto-created after previous PR merge):
git checkout feature/{issue-number}-descriptive-name

# 3b. If branch DOESN'T EXIST (out-of-sequence work, parallel development):
git checkout -b feature/{issue-number}-descriptive-name
```

**Branch Naming:** `feature/{issue-number}-descriptive-name`
- Example: `feature/42-github-oauth-login`

**When Branches Are Auto-Created:**
- After merging PR #004, workflow creates `feature/005-...`
- After merging PR #005, workflow creates `feature/006-...`
- See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section "Branch Auto-Creation"](../ARCHITECTURE.md#2-implementation-copilot-or-openhands) for details

**When to Create Manually:**
- Out-of-sequence work (e.g., starting #007 before #006)
- Parallel development
- First issue in a batch

### Step 3: Write Tests FIRST ‚úÖ (TDD)

**Test-Driven Development Process:**
1. Read acceptance criteria from issue
2. Write test that defines expected behavior
3. Run test (should FAIL - Red)
4. Write minimal code to make test pass (Green)
5. Refactor if needed
6. Repeat for next criterion

**Example TDD Cycle:**
```javascript
// 1. Write test FIRST
test('stores JWT token in localStorage with correct key', () => {
  const token = 'fake-jwt-token';
  authService.saveToken(token);
  expect(localStorage.getItem('devsmith_token')).toBe(token);
});

// 2. Run test - it FAILS (no authService.saveToken yet)

// 3. Write minimal code to pass
export const authService = {
  saveToken: (token) => {
    localStorage.setItem('devsmith_token', token);
  }
};

// 4. Run test - it PASSES

// 5. Refactor if needed

// 6. Move to next acceptance criterion
```

### Step 4: Implement Feature üíª

Follow **[ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13: DevSmith Coding Standards](../ARCHITECTURE.md#devsmith-coding-standards)** exactly.

**Key Standards (See ARCHITECTURE.md for full details):**
- File organization: `apps/{service}-{frontend|backend}/`
- Naming: `PascalCase.jsx`, `camelCase.js`, `snake_case.py`
- React components: Follow standard template (ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13)
- API calls: Follow error handling pattern (ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13)
- Error handling: Never return error strings as data
- Configuration: No hardcoded values, everything in .env
- Testing: 70% unit coverage, 90% critical path coverage

**DO NOT duplicate standards here. Reference ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13.**

### Step 5: Run Tests Locally üß™

**Before creating PR, ALL must pass:**

```bash
# Frontend tests
cd apps/{service}-frontend
npm test
npm run test:coverage  # Must be >= 70%

# Backend tests
cd apps/{service}-backend
pytest
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing  # Must be >= 70%
```

### Step 6: Complete Manual Testing Checklist ‚úì

See **[ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13 - Manual Testing Checklist](../ARCHITECTURE.md#manual-testing-checklist)** for full list.

**Critical items:**
- [ ] Feature works in browser
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Regression check (related features still work)
- [ ] Works through gateway (http://localhost:3000)
- [ ] Authentication persists across apps
- [ ] No hardcoded URLs

### Step 7: Commit & Create PR üöÄ

**Note:** Activity logging is automated via git hooks. Your commit message will automatically be logged to `.docs/devlog/copilot-activity.md` - no manual changelog updates needed!

```bash
# Commit with Conventional Commits format
# Include testing details and acceptance criteria in commit body
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement GitHub OAuth login

- Add OAuth endpoints to portal backend
- Create login component with OAuth button

```

### Step 9: Address Code Review Feedback üîÑ

When Claude reviews your PR:

1. **Read ALL comments carefully**
2. **Make requested changes**
3. **Push updates to same branch**
4. **Reply to comments** when fixed
5. **Request re-review**

**Don't:**
- Argue about standards (they're in ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Skip changes because "it works"
- Mark conversations resolved yourself
- Push without re-testing

---

## Critical Rules

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is REQUIRED

- Tests written BEFORE implementation code
- No exceptions
- If you write code first, Claude will reject PR

### 2. One Feature Per Issue, One Issue Per PR

- Don't add "bonus" features
- Don't fix unrelated bugs
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Stay focused on acceptance criteria

### 3. All Standards Are in ARCHITECTURE.md

- **DO NOT** guess at standards
- **DO** read [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13](../ARCHITECTURE.md#devsmith-coding-standards)
- **DO** follow templates exactly
- **DO** ask Claude if unsure

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Are Gates

- Every criterion must be 100% met
- Partial implementations will be rejected
- "Almost done" is not done
- If you can't meet a criterion, ask Claude for guidance

### 5. No Hardcoded Values

**EVER. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

All URLs, ports, API keys go in environment variables.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13 - Configuration Management](../ARCHITECTURE.md#configuration-management).

## When to Ask Claude for Help

### Ask Claude BEFORE coding if:
- Acceptance criteria unclear
- Unsure which service should handle logic
- Unsure about database schema design
- Architectural decision needed
- Approach might violate modularity

### Ask Claude DURING coding if:
- Tests failing after 3 attempts (three-strikes rule)
- Not sure how to structure something
- Conflicting requirements in issue

### Example Good Questions:
```
Claude, issue #42 says "store token in localStorage" but also mentions
"secure storage". Should I use localStorage or something more secure?

Claude, where should GitHub API calls live - in portal-backend or a
shared service? The issue doesn't specify.

Claude, I've tried 3 different approaches to fix this WebSocket issue
and all failed. Can you help diagnose the root cause?
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå DON'T:

1. **Write code before tests**
   - TDD is required, not optional

2. **Hardcode any values**
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå WRONG
   const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8001';

   // ‚úÖ RIGHT
   const API_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;
   ```

3. **Return error strings as data**
   ```python
   # ‚ùå WRONG
   try:
       return process()
   except Exception as e:
       return f"Error: {e}"  # Looks like valid data!

   # ‚úÖ RIGHT
   try:
       return process()
   except Exception as e:
       logger.error(f"Failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
       raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Process failed")
   ```

4. **Skip manual testing checklist**
   - Automated tests aren't enough
   - Must verify in actual browser
   - Must check through gateway

5. **Skip testing details in commit message**
   - Include test coverage and results in commit body
   - Activity logging system extracts this automatically
   - No need for separate AI_CHANGELOG.md (automated)

6. **Implement multiple features in one PR**
   - One issue = one PR
   - No scope creep

7. **Skip documentation references**
   - Read ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13
   - Follow templates exactly
   - Don't guess

8. **Argue with code review feedback**
   - Standards are standards
   - If you disagree, discuss with Mike
   - Don't mark resolved without fixing

## Documentation You Must Read

**Before starting ANY feature:**
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13](../ARCHITECTURE.md#devsmith-coding-standards)** - Coding standards (REQUIRED)
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md Section 14](../ARCHITECTURE.md#development-workflow)** - Workflow process
- **[Requirements.md](../Requirements.md)** - Feature requirements
- **[DevsmithTDD.md](../DevsmithTDD.md)** - TDD approach and test cases

**When stuck:**
- **[LESSONS_LEARNED.md](../LESSONS_LEARNED.md)** - Common mistakes to avoid

**Templates to use:**
- ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13 - React Component Structure

---

## Parallel Development

**Multiple Copilot instances can work simultaneously:**
- Each in separate VS Code window
- Each on different feature branch
- Each implementing different issue
- No conflicts as long as features are isolated

**Coordination:**
- Claude creates issues
- Mike assigns issues to different instances
- Each instance works independently
- PRs reviewed and merged independently

**Example:**
```
VS Code Window 1: feature/42-github-oauth-login
VS Code Window 2: feature/43-logs-dashboard-ui
VS Code Window 3: feature/44-analytics-trends-api
```

All three can be in progress simultaneously.
