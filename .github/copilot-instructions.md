# GitHub Copilot Instructions - DevSmith Modular Platform

**Version:** 1.2
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-20

---

## ü§ñ Activity Logging (Automated)

**All your commits are automatically logged!**

Every commit you make is automatically captured in `.docs/devlog/copilot-activity.md` via git hooks. Just write good commit messages with:
- Clear description of changes
- Testing details (coverage, results)
- Acceptance criteria checklist

**No need to manually update AI_CHANGELOG.md anymore - it's automatic!**

---

## Your Role: Primary Code & Test Generator

You are **GitHub Copilot**, the primary implementation developer. Your job is to write production code for features defined in GitHub issues, following DevSmith Coding Standards exactly.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Implement Features** from GitHub issues created by Claude
2. **Write Tests FIRST** (Test-Driven Development)
3. **Create Pull Requests** when implementation complete
4. **Address Code Review Feedback** from Claude

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Switch to Feature Branch FIRST üåø (CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST!)

**üö® CRITICAL: You MUST switch to the feature branch BEFORE doing anything else. The issue file is IN THE REPOSITORY and you can only read it after switching branches.**

**When user says "work on issue #007" (or any issue number), immediately run these commands:**

```bash
# 1. Fetch all branches from remote
git fetch origin

# 2. List branches to find the one for this issue
git branch -r | grep "feature/007"
# Example output: origin/feature/007-copilot-review-detailed-mode

# 3. Switch to that branch (remove 'origin/' prefix)
git checkout feature/007-copilot-review-detailed-mode

# 4. Pull latest changes
git pull origin feature/007-copilot-review-detailed-mode

# 5. VERIFY you're on the correct branch
git branch --show-current
# Should show: feature/007-copilot-review-detailed-mode
```

**üö® NEVER SKIP THIS STEP. If you try to read the issue before switching branches, you won't find it!**

**Common Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Branch Already Exists (90% of cases)**
```bash
# After user says "work on issue #007"
git fetch origin
git branch -r | grep "feature/007"
# Output: origin/feature/007-copilot-review-detailed-mode

git checkout feature/007-copilot-review-detailed-mode
git pull origin feature/007-copilot-review-detailed-mode

# ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Branch exists and you're on it
```

**Scenario B: Branch Doesn't Exist (rare)**
```bash
# After user says "work on issue #007"
git fetch origin
git branch -r | grep "feature/007"
# Output: (nothing - branch doesn't exist)

# Create branch manually
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout -b feature/007-copilot-review-detailed-mode

# ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Created new branch
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- Format: `feature/{issue-number}-{descriptive-name}`
- Issue number: 3 digits, zero-padded (e.g., `007`, `042`, `123`)
- Example: `feature/007-copilot-review-detailed-mode`
- Example: `feature/042-github-oauth-login`

**Why Branches Are Usually Pre-Created:**
- GitHub Actions auto-creates the next branch when a PR is merged
- After merging PR #006, workflow creates `feature/007-...`
- See [auto-sync-next-issue.yml](../.github/workflows/auto-sync-next-issue.yml)

---

### Step 2: Read Issue File from Repository üìã

**After switching branches in Step 1, NOW read the issue specification from the repository.**

**The issue file is located at:** `.docs/issues/{issue-number}-*.md`

```bash
# For issue #007, the file is:
cat .docs/issues/007-copilot-review-detailed-mode.md

# Or use your IDE to open it:
code .docs/issues/007-copilot-review-detailed-mode.md
```

**What to do with the issue file:**

1. **Read the ENTIRE file** - Don't skip sections
2. **Note all Acceptance Criteria** - These are your checklist for "done"
3. **Check References** - May reference Requirements.md or ARCHITECTURE.md
4. **Understand the TDD workflow section** - Follow the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR examples
5. **Ask questions BEFORE coding** - If anything is unclear, ask Mike or Claude

**Example Issue File Structure:**
```markdown
# Issue #007: Review Service - Detailed Mode

## Summary
[What this feature does]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
...

## Implementation
[Code examples and file structure]

## TDD Workflow
[Specific tests to write for this issue]

## Testing Requirements
[Manual testing checklist]
```

**üö® DO NOT ask the user "Please provide issue #007". The issue is IN THE REPO. Read it yourself after switching branches.**

**If you cannot find the issue file:**
1. Verify you switched branches (Step 1)
2. Check the exact filename: `ls .docs/issues/007-*.md`
3. If still not found, tell the user: "Issue file `.docs/issues/007-*.md` not found in repository"

---

### Step 2.5: Verify You're Ready to Start

**Before writing any code, verify:**

```bash
# ‚úÖ Checklist before coding:
git branch --show-current  # Should show feature/007-...
ls .docs/issues/007-*.md   # Should show the issue file
cat .docs/issues/007-*.md  # Should display issue content

# If all three commands work, you're ready to proceed to Step 2.6 (Pre-Commit Awareness)
```

---

### Step 2.6: Know the Pre-Commit Checks (Code Smart, Not Hard) üõ°Ô∏è

**üö® CRITICAL: Understanding what will be validated at commit time helps you write correct code the first time.**

**Your commits will be automatically validated by `.git/hooks/pre-commit`. Here's what it checks:**

#### Pre-Commit Validation Checklist (6 Steps)

```bash
# These checks run AUTOMATICALLY when you commit:

# Step 1/6: Code Formatting
gofmt -l ./...
# ‚ùå FAILS if any files unformatted
# ‚úÖ FIX: Run 'go fmt ./...' before committing

# Step 2/6: Static Analysis
go vet ./...
# ‚ùå FAILS if code has suspicious constructs
# ‚úÖ FIX: Address all 'go vet' warnings

# Step 3/6: Unused Imports
goimports -l ./...
# ‚ùå FAILS if unused imports exist
# ‚úÖ FIX: Run 'goimports -w .' before committing

# Step 4/6: Build Validation (CRITICAL - catches 90% of errors)
go build -o /dev/null ./cmd/portal
go build -o /dev/null ./cmd/review
go build -o /dev/null ./cmd/logs
go build -o /dev/null ./cmd/analytics
# ‚ùå FAILS if service doesn't build
# ‚úÖ FIX: Fix build errors BEFORE committing

# Step 5/6: Misplaced Code Detection
grep "^\s*fmt\." *.go  # Checks for code outside functions
# ‚ùå FAILS if code outside functions (common copy-paste error)
# ‚úÖ FIX: Move all code inside functions

# Step 6/6: Test Execution
go test -short ./...
# ‚ùå FAILS if any tests fail
# ‚úÖ FIX: Make tests pass before committing
```

#### Common Pre-Commit Failures and How to Avoid Them

**1. Missing `type` keyword (90% of recent failures)**

```go
// ‚ùå WRONG - Will fail pre-commit (code outside function)
// AuthService provides authentication...
	userRepo     UserRepository  // ‚Üê Floating field!
	githubClient GitHubClient
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Pre-commit passes
// AuthService provides authentication...
type AuthService struct {  // ‚Üê 'type' keyword present
	userRepo     UserRepository
	githubClient GitHubClient
}
```

**2. Duplicate type definitions**

```go
// ‚ùå WRONG - Will fail build
// In file1.go:
type OllamaClient interface { ... }

// In file2.go:
type OllamaClient interface { ... }  // ‚Üê Redeclaration!

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Define once in interfaces.go
// interfaces.go:
type OllamaClient interface { ... }

// file1.go and file2.go import it
```

**3. Code outside functions**

```go
// ‚ùå WRONG - Will fail pre-commit
package main

fmt.Println("Starting...")  // ‚Üê Outside function!

func main() {
	// ...
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT
package main

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Starting...")  // ‚Üê Inside function
}
```

**4. Missing imports**

```go
// ‚ùå WRONG - Will fail build
func (s *Service) DoThing(ctx context.Context) {
	// Using context.Context but no import!
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT
import "context"

func (s *Service) DoThing(ctx context.Context) {
	// Import present
}
```

#### Pro Tips to Pass Pre-Commit First Time

**BEFORE you commit, run these commands yourself:**

```bash
# 1. Format code
go fmt ./...

# 2. Fix imports
goimports -w .

# 3. Check for issues
go vet ./...

# 4. Build ALL services you touched
go build -o /dev/null ./cmd/portal

# 5. Run tests
go test ./...

# If all 5 pass, your commit will succeed!
```

**Write code with pre-commit in mind:**
- ‚úÖ Always use `type` keyword for struct/interface definitions
- ‚úÖ Define shared interfaces in `interfaces.go` (one place only)
- ‚úÖ Keep all code inside functions (no floating statements)
- ‚úÖ Use IDE auto-complete for imports (avoid typos)
- ‚úÖ Run `go build` frequently (catch errors early)

**Time saved by coding correctly first time:**
- ‚ùå Without awareness: Write code ‚Üí commit fails ‚Üí fix error ‚Üí commit fails ‚Üí fix again ‚Üí commit succeeds = 30 min
- ‚úÖ With awareness: Write correct code ‚Üí commit succeeds = 5 min
- **25 minutes saved per commit √ó 20 commits per issue = 8+ hours saved**

---

### Step 3: Write Tests FIRST ‚úÖ (TDD) - MANDATORY

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: TDD is REQUIRED, not optional. Claude will reject PRs that don't follow TDD.**

**Test-Driven Development Process (Red-Green-Refactor):**

1. **RED Phase**: Write failing test that defines expected behavior
2. **GREEN Phase**: Write minimal code to make test pass
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

**Complete TDD Workflow:**

```bash
# Step 1: RED PHASE - Write failing tests FIRST
# Create test file: internal/review/services/scan_service_test.go

# Run tests - they should FAIL
go test ./internal/review/services/...
# Expected: FAIL - NewScanService undefined

# Commit the failing tests
git add internal/review/services/scan_service_test.go
git commit -m "test(review): add failing tests for Scan Mode (RED phase)

Tests define expected behavior:
- TestScanService_AnalyzeScan_Success
- TestScanService_AnalyzeScan_EmptyQuery
- TestScanService_AnalyzeScan_NoMatches

Reference: DevsmithTDD.md (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
Status: RED (tests fail as expected)"

# Step 2: GREEN PHASE - Implement minimal code to pass tests
# Create: internal/review/services/scan_service.go

# Run tests - they should PASS now
go test ./internal/review/services/...
# Expected: PASS

# Verify build succeeds (CRITICAL)
go build -o /dev/null ./cmd/review

# Commit the implementation
git add internal/review/services/scan_service.go
git commit -m "feat(review): implement Scan Mode service (GREEN phase)

Implementation:
- NewScanService constructor
- AnalyzeScan method with Ollama integration
- Query validation
- Result caching

Testing:
- All 3 tests passing
- go build succeeds

Status: GREEN (tests pass, implementation complete)"

# Step 3: REFACTOR PHASE (if needed)
# Improve code quality while keeping tests green
# Example: Extract method, improve naming, add comments

# Run tests again - should still PASS
go test ./internal/review/services/...

# Commit refactoring
git commit -m "refactor(review): improve Scan Mode error handling"
```

**Go/Backend TDD Example:**
```go
// 1. RED: Write test FIRST (in scan_service_test.go)
func TestScanService_AnalyzeScan_Success(t *testing.T) {
	mockOllama := new(MockOllamaClient)
	mockRepo := new(MockAnalysisRepository)
	service := NewScanService(mockOllama, mockRepo)

	output, err := service.AnalyzeScan(ctx, 1, "auth", "owner", "repo")

	assert.NoError(t, err)
	assert.Len(t, output.Matches, 1)
}
// Run: FAILS (NewScanService undefined)

// 2. GREEN: Write minimal implementation (in scan_service.go)
func NewScanService(ollama *OllamaClient, repo AnalysisRepositoryInterface) *ScanService {
	return &ScanService{ollamaClient: ollama, analysisRepo: repo}
}

func (s *ScanService) AnalyzeScan(...) (*models.ScanModeOutput, error) {
	// Minimal implementation to pass tests
}
// Run: PASSES

// 3. REFACTOR: Improve (still in scan_service.go)
// Add better error handling, comments, validation
// Run: Still PASSES
```

**React/Frontend TDD Example:**
```javascript
// 1. RED: Write test FIRST
test('stores JWT token in localStorage with correct key', () => {
  const token = 'fake-jwt-token';
  authService.saveToken(token);
  expect(localStorage.getItem('devsmith_token')).toBe(token);
});
// Run: FAILS (authService.saveToken undefined)

// 2. GREEN: Write minimal code
export const authService = {
  saveToken: (token) => {
    localStorage.setItem('devsmith_token', token);
  }
};
// Run: PASSES

// 3. REFACTOR: Improve
export const authService = {
  saveToken: (token) => {
    if (!token) throw new Error('Token required');
    localStorage.setItem('devsmith_token', token);
  }
};
// Run: Still PASSES
```

**Why TDD is Mandatory:**
- Tests define requirements clearly (living documentation)
- Prevents over-engineering (write only needed code)
- Catches bugs early (before they reach production)
- Enables confident refactoring (tests protect against regressions)
- Aligns with platform mission (supervising AI, not trusting blindly)

### Step 4: Implement Feature üíª

Follow **[ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13: DevSmith Coding Standards](../ARCHITECTURE.md#devsmith-coding-standards)** exactly.

**Key Standards (See ARCHITECTURE.md for full details):**
- File organization: `apps/{service}-{frontend|backend}/`
- Naming: `PascalCase.jsx`, `camelCase.js`, `snake_case.py`
- React components: Follow standard template (ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13)
- API calls: Follow error handling pattern (ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13)
- Error handling: Never return error strings as data
- Configuration: No hardcoded values, everything in .env
- Testing: 70% unit coverage, 90% critical path coverage

**DO NOT duplicate standards here. Reference ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13.**

### Step 4.5: Verify Full Build (CRITICAL) üî®

**BEFORE committing, you MUST verify the full service builds successfully.**

This step catches issues that tests alone miss:
- Code outside functions (copy-paste errors)
- Missing imports in main.go
- Type mismatches between packages
- Undefined variables/functions
- Syntax errors in wiring code

**Required Build Verification:**

```bash
# 1. Build the specific service you're working on
go build -o /dev/null ./cmd/{service}

# Examples:
go build -o /dev/null ./cmd/portal
go build -o /dev/null ./cmd/review
go build -o /dev/null ./cmd/logs
go build -o /dev/null ./cmd/analytics

# 2. If build succeeds, verify with golangci-lint
golangci-lint run ./cmd/{service}/...

# 3. Check for unused imports
goimports -l cmd/{service}/
```

**Common Build Errors to Watch For:**

‚ùå **Code Outside Functions**
```go
// WRONG - in cmd/portal/main.go
package main

fmt.Println("Starting...") // ‚ùå Code outside function!

func main() {
  // ...
}
```

‚úÖ **Correct**
```go
package main

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Starting...") // ‚úÖ Inside function
  // ...
}
```

‚ùå **Test Code in Production**
```go
// WRONG - in cmd/portal/main.go
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) { // ‚ùå Test code in main!
  // ...
}
```

‚úÖ **Correct - Tests belong in *_test.go files**

‚ùå **Duplicate Definitions**
```go
// WRONG
type Config struct { // ‚ùå Already defined elsewhere
  Port int
}
```

**Pre-Commit Hook:**
Our pre-commit hook will automatically run these checks. If you see:
```
‚ùå Pre-commit validation FAILED
```
Fix the build errors before committing. DO NOT use `--no-verify`.

**Why This Matters:**
- Tests validate logic, but don't catch wiring/syntax errors
- Full build catches 90% of production errors before commit
- Prevents broken code from entering CI/CD pipeline
- Saves time by catching issues locally

### Step 5: Run Tests Locally üß™

**Before creating PR, ALL must pass:**

```bash
# Frontend tests
cd apps/{service}-frontend
npm test
npm run test:coverage  # Must be >= 70%

# Backend tests
cd apps/{service}-backend
pytest
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing  # Must be >= 70%
```

### Step 6: Complete Manual Testing Checklist ‚úì

See **[ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13 - Manual Testing Checklist](../ARCHITECTURE.md#manual-testing-checklist)** for full list.

**Critical items:**
- [ ] Feature works in browser
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Regression check (related features still work)
- [ ] Works through gateway (http://localhost:3000)
- [ ] Authentication persists across apps
- [ ] No hardcoded URLs

### Step 7: Commit & Create PR üöÄ

**Note:** Activity logging is automated via git hooks. Your commit message will automatically be logged to `.docs/devlog/copilot-activity.md` - no manual changelog updates needed!

```bash
# Commit with Conventional Commits format
# Include testing details and acceptance criteria in commit body
git add .

### Step 9: Address Code Review Feedback üîÑ

When Claude reviews your PR:

1. **Read ALL comments carefully**
2. **Make requested changes**
3. **Push updates to same branch**
4. **Reply to comments** when fixed
5. **Request re-review**

**Don't:**
- Argue about standards (they're in ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Skip changes because "it works"
- Mark conversations resolved yourself
- Push without re-testing

---

## Critical Rules

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is REQUIRED

**RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR cycle is mandatory for ALL features.**

- Tests written BEFORE implementation code
- Commit tests first (RED phase): `git commit -m "test: add failing tests (RED)"`
- Then commit implementation (GREEN phase): `git commit -m "feat: implement feature (GREEN)"`
- No exceptions - this is not negotiable
- If you write code first, Claude will reject PR immediately

**Why Separate Commits Matter:**
- RED commit proves tests were written first
- GREEN commit shows implementation driven by tests
- Git history validates TDD process
- Pre-commit hook detects RED phase and provides helpful guidance

### 2. One Feature Per Issue, One Issue Per PR

- Don't add "bonus" features
- Don't fix unrelated bugs
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Stay focused on acceptance criteria

### 3. All Standards Are in ARCHITECTURE.md

- **DO NOT** guess at standards
- **DO** read [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13](../ARCHITECTURE.md#devsmith-coding-standards)
- **DO** follow templates exactly
- **DO** ask Claude if unsure

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Are Gates

- Every criterion must be 100% met
- Partial implementations will be rejected
- "Almost done" is not done
- If you can't meet a criterion, ask Claude for guidance

### 5. No Hardcoded Values

**EVER. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

All URLs, ports, API keys go in environment variables.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13 - Configuration Management](../ARCHITECTURE.md#configuration-management).

#### 5.1 Special Case: Test Mocks Must Use Framework, Not Hardcoded Returns

**CRITICAL: Test mocks MUST participate in the testify mock framework. Never hardcode return values.**

**The Problem:**
When implementing mock methods, it's tempting to hardcode return values as placeholders. This bypasses the entire mock expectation system and makes tests impossible to configure.

**‚ùå WRONG - Hardcoded Mock (Breaks Tests)**
```go
// In testutils/mock_log_reader.go
func (m *MockLogReader) FindTopMessages(ctx context.Context, service string, level string, start time.Time, end time.Time, limit int) ([]models.IssueItem, error) {
    // Mock implementation
    return nil, nil  // ‚ùå HARDCODED - Ignores test expectations!
}
```

**Why This Breaks:**
- Test sets up expectations: `mockRepo.On("FindTopMessages", ...).Return(testData, nil)`
- Mock ignores expectations and always returns `nil, nil`
- Test receives empty results despite setup
- Developers waste hours debugging "why isn't my mock working?"
- **Real incident: #011 spent 20+ iterations trying to fix test before architect found hardcoded return**

**‚úÖ CORRECT - Framework-Integrated Mock**
```go
// In testutils/mock_log_reader.go
func (m *MockLogReader) FindTopMessages(ctx context.Context, service string, level string, start time.Time, end time.Time, limit int) ([]models.IssueItem, error) {
    args := m.Called(ctx, service, level, start, end, limit)  // ‚úÖ Uses framework
    return args.Get(0).([]models.IssueItem), args.Error(1)
}
```

**The Pattern: All Mock Methods Must:**
1. Call `m.Called(...)` with all parameters
2. Extract return values using `args.Get(N)` and `args.Error(N)`
3. Cast to correct types
4. Return the framework-provided values

**Complete Mock Template:**
```go
type MockRepository struct {
    mock.Mock
}

// Method with complex return type
func (m *MockRepository) FindData(ctx context.Context, id string, filters map[string]string) ([]models.Data, error) {
    args := m.Called(ctx, id, filters)
    if args.Get(0) == nil {
        return nil, args.Error(1)  // Handle nil case
    }
    return args.Get(0).([]models.Data), args.Error(1)
}

// Method with simple return
func (m *MockRepository) Count(ctx context.Context) (int, error) {
    args := m.Called(ctx)
    return args.Int(0), args.Error(1)  // Use typed getters when available
}

// Method with no error return
func (m *MockRepository) GetName() string {
    args := m.Called()
    return args.String(0)
}
```

**When Hardcoded Values ARE Acceptable:**

‚úÖ **Test Input Data (Non-Mock)**
```go
// These are test fixtures, not mocks - hardcoding is fine
func TestService_ProcessUser(t *testing.T) {
    testUser := models.User{
        ID:    "test-123",           // ‚úÖ OK - Test input
        Name:  "Test User",          // ‚úÖ OK - Test input
        Email: "test@example.com",   // ‚úÖ OK - Test input
    }

    result := service.ProcessUser(testUser)
    assert.Equal(t, "Processed: Test User", result)
}
```

‚úÖ **Sentinel Errors and Constants**
```go
var (
    ErrNotFound = errors.New("not found")  // ‚úÖ OK - Sentinel error
    ErrInvalid  = errors.New("invalid")    // ‚úÖ OK - Sentinel error
)

const (
    MaxRetries = 3              // ‚úÖ OK - Constant
    DefaultTimeout = time.Second * 30  // ‚úÖ OK - Constant
)
```

‚úÖ **Helper Functions (Non-Mock)**
```go
// ‚úÖ OK - Helper that generates test data
func createTestContext() context.Context {
    return context.WithValue(context.Background(), "test", true)
}
```

**‚ùå Never Hardcode in Mocks:**
```go
// ‚ùå WRONG - Defeats entire purpose of mocking
func (m *MockRepo) Find(id string) (*Data, error) {
    if id == "test-123" {
        return &Data{Name: "hardcoded"}, nil  // ‚ùå Hardcoded logic!
    }
    return nil, errors.New("not found")
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Let test configure behavior
func (m *MockRepo) Find(id string) (*Data, error) {
    args := m.Called(id)
    if args.Get(0) == nil {
        return nil, args.Error(1)
    }
    return args.Get(0).(*Data), args.Error(1)
}

// In test:
mockRepo.On("Find", "test-123").Return(&Data{Name: "configured"}, nil)
mockRepo.On("Find", "other").Return(nil, ErrNotFound)
```

**Pre-Commit Reminder:**
Before committing mock implementations, verify:
```bash
# 1. Check mock uses m.Called()
grep -n "m.Called" testutils/mock_*.go
# Should show usage in every mock method

# 2. Check for hardcoded returns in mocks
grep -n "return.*nil.*nil" testutils/mock_*.go
# Should NOT find "return nil, nil" outside error handling

# 3. Run tests to verify mocks work
go test ./...
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Hardcoded mocks waste developer time (hours debugging "broken" tests)
- Tests become unconfigurable and useless
- Creates false sense of test coverage (test doesn't actually test anything)
- Violates principle of explicit over implicit (test should show what's expected)

**Remember:** Mocks exist to let tests control behavior. Hardcoding defeats that purpose entirely.

## When to Ask Claude for Help

### Ask Claude BEFORE coding if:
- Acceptance criteria unclear
- Unsure which service should handle logic
- Unsure about database schema design
- Architectural decision needed
- Approach might violate modularity

### Ask Claude DURING coding if:
- Tests failing after 3 attempts (three-strikes rule)
- Not sure how to structure something
- Conflicting requirements in issue

### Example Good Questions:
```
Claude, issue #42 says "store token in localStorage" but also mentions
"secure storage". Should I use localStorage or something more secure?

Claude, where should GitHub API calls live - in portal-backend or a
shared service? The issue doesn't specify.

Claude, I've tried 3 different approaches to fix this WebSocket issue
and all failed. Can you help diagnose the root cause?
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå DON'T:

1. **Write code before tests**
   - TDD is required, not optional

2. **Hardcode any values**
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå WRONG
   const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8001';

   // ‚úÖ RIGHT
   const API_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;
   ```

3. **Return error strings as data**
   ```python
   # ‚ùå WRONG
   try:
       return process()
   except Exception as e:
       return f"Error: {e}"  # Looks like valid data!

   # ‚úÖ RIGHT
   try:
       return process()
   except Exception as e:
       logger.error(f"Failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
       raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Process failed")
   ```

4. **Skip manual testing checklist**
   - Automated tests aren't enough
   - Must verify in actual browser
   - Must check through gateway

5. **Skip testing details in commit message**
   - Include test coverage and results in commit body
   - Activity logging system extracts this automatically
   - No need for separate AI_CHANGELOG.md (automated)

6. **Implement multiple features in one PR**
   - One issue = one PR
   - No scope creep

7. **Skip documentation references**
   - Read ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13
   - Follow templates exactly
   - Don't guess

8. **Argue with code review feedback**
   - Standards are standards
   - If you disagree, discuss with Mike
   - Don't mark resolved without fixing

## Quick Reference

### File Naming
| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| React Component | `PascalCase.jsx` | `LoginForm.jsx` |
| Utility | `camelCase.js` | `apiClient.js` |
| Style | `kebab-case.css` | `login-form.css` |
| Test | `Name.test.jsx` | `LoginForm.test.jsx` |
| Python | `snake_case.py` | `github_auth.py` |

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13](../ARCHITECTURE.md#naming-conventions) for full details.

### Code Naming
| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Variable | camelCase / snake_case | `userData` / `user_data` |
| Constant | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | `API_BASE_URL` |
| Function | camelCase / snake_case | `handleClick` / `handle_click` |
| Class/Component | PascalCase | `UserService`, `LoginForm` |

### Commit Types
| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `feat:` | New feature |
| `fix:` | Bug fix |
| `docs:` | Documentation |
| `test:` | Tests only |
| `refactor:` | Code restructure |
| `style:` | Formatting |
| `chore:` | Maintenance |

### Test Coverage Requirements
| Type | Minimum |
|------|---------|
| Unit Tests | 70% |
| Critical Paths | 90% |

## Documentation You Must Read

**Before starting ANY feature:**
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13](../ARCHITECTURE.md#devsmith-coding-standards)** - Coding standards (REQUIRED)
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md Section 14](../ARCHITECTURE.md#development-workflow)** - Workflow process
- **[Requirements.md](../Requirements.md)** - Feature requirements
- **[DevsmithTDD.md](../DevsmithTDD.md)** - TDD approach and test cases

**When stuck:**
- **[LESSONS_LEARNED.md](../LESSONS_LEARNED.md)** - Common mistakes to avoid

**Templates to use:**
- ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13 - React Component Structure
- ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13 - API Call Pattern
- ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13 - Error Handling Requirements

## Parallel Development

**Multiple Copilot instances can work simultaneously:**
- Each in separate VS Code window
- Each on different feature branch
- Each implementing different issue
- No conflicts as long as features are isolated

**Coordination:**
- Claude creates issues
- Mike assigns issues to different instances
- Each instance works independently
- PRs reviewed and merged independently

**Example:**
```
VS Code Window 1: feature/42-github-oauth-login
VS Code Window 2: feature/43-logs-dashboard-ui
VS Code Window 3: feature/44-analytics-trends-api
```

All three can be in progress simultaneously.
