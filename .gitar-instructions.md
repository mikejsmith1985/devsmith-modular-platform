# Gitar Instructions
- Always follow semantic versioning for dependency updates.
- For test failures, add mocks before altering assertions.
- Never auto-merge security-related fixes—flag for human review.
- Reference copilot-instructions.md for code style guidelines.
- ensure that fixes align with the architecture also IE if somethign refrences Python and we don't use python we should be removing it not adding it in to satisfy the test. See architecural references below.
